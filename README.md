# Daniel Iser

**Founder & Lead Engineer at [Code Atlantic](https://github.com/code-atlantic)** — building software that powers billions of interactions across the web.

I create developer tools, WordPress products, and SaaS platforms. My work has touched virtually every internet user on the planet — our products have driven **28+ billion popup views** and run on **700,000+ websites**.

## What I'm Building

- **[Popup Maker](https://wppopupmaker.com)** — The most widely adopted popup & conversion toolkit for WordPress
- **[Content Control](https://github.com/code-atlantic/content-control)** — Granular content restriction & access control for WordPress

## Open Source

I've spent over a decade contributing to the WordPress ecosystem and open-source PHP/JS tooling. A few things I've released:

- **[Chophper](https://github.com/code-atlantic/chophper)** — HTML-aware text truncation for PHP (handles nested tags cleanly)
